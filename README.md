# lifetracker

## Description

This is my side project called lifetracker, which is a website for tracking diet. This website can help users track the food they consume each day and their caloric intake. I used the Java language and Spring Boot framework to build the backend and implemented connectivity to a MySQL database using Spring MVC and MyBatis. I also used Spring Security to implement user login and permission management. On the front end, I used JavaScript and the Bootstrap framework to design a responsive interface.

## Installation
This project is a web-based application that allows users to perform various functions within their browser. To use this project, you first need to run the entire project, which can be done through the command line or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). After running the project, a local server will start and listen on port 8080. Then, users simply need to open a web page and connect to localhost:8080 to see the main interface of this project. On the main interface, users can choose different functional modules and follow the instructions to operate. The usage of this project is very simple and convenient without requiring any additional software or plugins.
